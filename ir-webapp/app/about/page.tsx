        The SEC requires all insiders to report purchases and sales of their
        company's securities by filing SEC Form 4. We track the filing of these
        forms <i>up to the minute</i> and make them easy to search, sort and
        filter. <Link href="/alerts">Alerts</Link> and{" "}

        The SEC require certain individuals (such as officers, directors, and
        those that hold more than 10% of any class of a companyâ€™s securities) to
        report purchases, sales, and holdings of their company's securities by
        filing forms 3, 4, and 5.
        <br />
        <br />
        In most cases, when an insider executes a transaction, he or she must
        file a Form 4. This form includes the amount purchased or sold and the
        price per share. Form 4 must be filed within two business days following
        the transaction date. Transactions in a company's common stock as well
        as derivative securities, such as options, warrants, and convertible
        securities, are reported on the form. Each transaction is coded to
        indicate the nature of the transaction.
